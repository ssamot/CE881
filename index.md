# CE881: Mobile and Social Application Programming

## Introduction
In this course you will learn how to develop mobile / social applications for Android devices.

The module outline can be found [here](http://www.essex.ac.uk/modules/default.aspx?coursecode=CE881&level=7&period=SP).  Note that this is a very hands-on course, where the main aim is to maximise your potential as mobile and social application programmers using the Android platform.  Assessment is via coursework only, though this does include a multi-choice progress test.

During the course we'll study a range of apps.  The course involves a two-hour lecture slot and a three-hour lab slot each week.  Attendance at lectures and labs is mandatory.

The lectures will be rather informal and involve plenty of class discussion, plus short presentations from students taking the course.

The lecture notes and lab scripts for this course will be made available and further developed during the course.  Extensive use will be made of external Android developer resources.

## Lectures
Lectures take place on **Tuesday 09:00-11:00 at Room TC1.12** in the Teaching centre.
