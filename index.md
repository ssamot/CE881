# CE881: Mobile and Social Application Programming

## Introduction
In this course you will learn how to develop mobile / social applications for Android devices.

The module outline can be found [here](http://www.essex.ac.uk/modules/default.aspx?coursecode=CE881&level=7&period=SP).  Note that this is a very hands-on course, where the main aim is to maximise your potential as mobile and social application programmers using the Android platform.  Assessment is via coursework only, though this does include a multi-choice progress test.

During the course we'll study a range of apps.  The course involves a two-hour lecture slot and a three-hour lab slot each week.  Attendance at lectures and labs is mandatory.

The lectures will be rather informal and involve plenty of class discussion, plus short presentations from students taking the course.

The lecture notes and lab scripts for this course will be made available and further developed during the course.  Extensive use will be made of external Android developer resources.

## IDEs
You can use whatever IDE you want for the course, however the three proposed ones are:

*  [IntelliJIDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
*  [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
*  [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

## Assessment

The assessment schedule is listed below.  The main assignment is to produce an Android app; this is split into two parts to help ensure that you make steady progress.  Assignment 1 is to design and describe a prototype of your app.  Assignment 2 is to implement the complete app and write a report on it.

Some ideas for possible apps are provided [here](./labs/suggestions/suggestions.html).

* Assigments and Tests
	* [Assignment 1](./assignments/CE881Assignment1.pdf)
	* [Assignment 2](./assignments/CE881Assignment2.pdf)
	* Progress Test [sample](./assignments/sample_progress_test.pdf)
