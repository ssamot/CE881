<H2>CE881 Lab 1: Introduction</H2>
<DIV class=main>
<H3><A name=Introduction>Introduction</A></H3>
	<p>The aim of this lab is to gain familiarity with using a Java IDE together 
	with the Android development tools.&nbsp; You are assumed to be familiar 
	with Java and Java IDEs in general, and ideally with Eclipse or Intellij in 
	particular.&nbsp; If not then seek assistance from the lab or module 
	supervisor.</p>
	<p>The lab will work through some standard training tutorials from the 
	Android Developer site, set some related exercises for you to complete and 
	then finish with a quiz to test your understanding of the material covered.</p>
	<p>This lab will introduce the following concepts:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Building and running a hello world program</li>
		<li>Editing XML files to create a GUI</li>
		<li>Using Layouts (these are containers that arrange other components - 
		their children).&nbsp; In particular we'll experiment with 
		LinearLayout's</li>
		<li>Setting LinearLayout parameters such as width and weight to achieve 
		desired effects</li>
		<li>Hooking up events to make GUI components actually <em>do something</em>.</li>
		<li>Using Intents to invoke other Activities</li>
	</ul>
	<h3><a name="First App">First App</a></h3>
	<p>Work through the steps:
	<a href="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html">
	First App</a></p>
	<p>For this lab, the most important steps are the first three: <em>Creating 
	an Android Project</em>, <em>Running Your Application</em> and <em>Building 
	a Simple User Interface</em>.&nbsp; The <em>Starting Another Activity</em> 
	complicates things a bit by introducing Intents which we'll cover in more 
	depth later.</p>
	<p><img alt="First App" src="img5.gif"></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Note: when creating the project, it is only necessary to do this 
		using an IDE (Eclipse), the part using command line tools is optional, 
		though may be useful for those rare cases where the IDE does not do what 
		you need.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When creating the app, the expected initial view is shown in the 
	Graphical Layout pane: you can use this to drag and drop new components, 
	which will auto-update the XML layout file.&nbsp; For example, I called my 
	App &quot;SimpleHelloWorld&quot;, and after going through the create menues in Eclipse 
	it looked like this:</p>
	<p><img alt="SimpleHello Graphical Layout" src="img7.jpg"></p>
	<p>Now, specify a virtual device and run the App on it: you should get 
	something like this:</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Simple Hello on Emulator" height="481" src="img8.jpg" width="453"></p>
	<p>Question: note that the TextView says &quot;Hello world!&quot;.&nbsp; Where is this 
	string declared?</p>
	<p>Work through the rest of the tutorial lab and ensure that everything 
	works as expected.&nbsp; You should end up with an App that calls another 
	App like this:</p>
	<p><img alt="Calling a Second Activity" src="img9.jpg"></p>
	<h3><a name="Exercise:_SeekBars">Exercise: SeekBars</a></h3>
	<p>The exercise for this lab is to create an app that looks like the one 
	below: each <strong>SeekBar</strong> (the slider) is hooked up to a text 
	field (in this case I used <strong>EditText</strong> components) so that as 
	the slider is moved, a value in the text field is updated.</p>
	<p><img alt="Simple SeekBar test" src="img4.jpg"></p>
	<p>The components should be arranged using LinearLayouts (I'll leave the 
	choice of how to do this to you).</p>
	<p>We've not covered how to do listen for events from a SeekBar component, 
	but I want you to practice searching for the information: try a Google 
	search on &quot;Android Seekbar Example&quot;.&nbsp; By default the values returned by 
	a SeekBar range from 0 to 100.&nbsp; Demonstrate your solutions when you're 
	ready.</p>
	<h3><a name="Quiz">Quiz</a></h3>
	<p>You should attempt all the questions in the following quiz.&nbsp; You can 
	find some of the answers in the lab work you've already done: some others 
	you may need to search for.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Which XML file specifies the name of the App?</li>
		<li>Which XML file specifies the components and layout of the GUI?&nbsp; 
		In which folder is the file located?</li>
		<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of specifying GUI layouts in 
		XML versus in the app's Java code?</li>
		<li>What does the &quot;@&quot; specify in an XML attribute? (<strong>android:text=&quot;@string/hello_world&quot;</strong>)</li>
		<li>What does the &quot;@+&quot; specify? (e.g. <strong>android:id=&quot;@+id/seekBar1</strong>&quot;)</li>
		<li>When using a LinearLayout when does it make sense to set the width 
		or the height to 0dp?</li>
		<li>When specifying the width or the height of a component what do 
		&quot;match_parent&quot; and &quot;wrap_content&quot; mean?</li>
		<li>What does DDMS stand for?</li>
		<li>What is the origin of the Java code in the <strong>gen</strong> 
		directory, and why should you never edit it directly?</li>
		<li>Why should you start an AVD (Android Virtual Device) at the start of 
		a programming session and then leave the device running?</li>
	</ol>
