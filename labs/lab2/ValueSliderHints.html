<H2>CE881: ValueSlider Hints</H2>
<DIV class=main>
<H3><a name="Outline">Outline</a></H3>
	<p>The solution is split into four classes: a modified version of 
	LissajousView, a new ValueSlider class, an interface called 
	ValueChangeListener and the main activity, in this case called MyActivity.</p>
	<p><img alt="Class Diagram" src="img4.jpg"></p>
	<p>The diagram above shows that MyActivity creates LissajousView and 
	ValueSlider objects, that each ValueSlider has a reference to a single 
	ValueChangeListener, and that LissajousView implements the 
	ValueChangeListener interface.</p>
	<H3><a name="ValueSlider">ValueSlider</a></H3>
	<p>Each ValueSlider object connects a SeekBar with a TextField, as shown 
	below:&nbsp; (sorry about the poor image!)</p>
	<p><img alt="ValueSlider Image" src="img5.jpg"></p>
	<p>ValueSliders in my design also know about scaling factors, and the number 
	of significant digits to show after the decimal point.&nbsp; This leads to 
	the following class declaration:</p>
	<p><img alt="ValueSlider Declaration" src="img6.gif"></p>
	<p>Next we consider the constructor.&nbsp; This is where we'll set up the 
	event handler for the SeekBar, plus of course assigning the instance 
	variables.&nbsp; I've split the constructor into two images below: this is 
	all within the same constructor.&nbsp; First we assign the instance 
	variables and instantiate the TextView and SeekBar, setting up the layout 
	parameters (similar to how they were specified in the XML version).</p>
	<p><img alt="ValueSlider Constructor Part One" src="img8.gif"></p>
	<p>Next we set up the SeekBar event handler.&nbsp; When a SeekBar is 
	adjusted, we need to calculate the new value by dividing the progress by the 
	range, change the value in the text field, then call the ValueChangeListener 
	to notify it of the new value.</p>
	<p><img alt="ValueSlider Constrcutor (Continued)" src="imgA.gif"></p>
	<h3><a name="ValueChangeListener">ValueChangeListener</a></h3>
	<p>This interface is really simple:</p>
	<p><img alt="ValueChangeListener" src="imgC.gif"></p>
	<h3><a name="LissajousView">LissajousView</a></h3>
	<p>This class is similar to the previous one, except that now the variables 
	are stored in a TreeMap, with the names of the variables set up as static 
	variables.&nbsp; Note the new addition to the init() method where some 
	default values are added to the map.</p>
	<p><img alt="LissajousView vars and init()" src="img10.gif"></p>
	<p>The other change required is to retrieve the variables from the Map each 
	time the curve is drawn.&nbsp; Hence, the first part of drawTrack now 
	becomes (with the new lines highlighted).</p>
	<p><img alt="drawTrack()" src="img12.gif"></p>
	<p>The rest of it remains unchanged.</p>
	<h3><a name="MyActivity">MyActivity</a></h3>
	<p>Compare this to thre previous version and note how compact this one is.&nbsp; 
	In particular note the use of the loop over the set of keys on the <strong>
	vars</strong> TreeMap, setting up a ValueSlider for each one, assigning the 
	lissajousView object to listen for events, and adding it to the root layout.</p>
	<p><img alt="MyActivity" src="imgE.gif"></p>
	<p>This new version is shorter and makes better use of reusable code, though 
	it took more effort to develop.&nbsp; Was the effort worth it?&nbsp; Discuss 
	...</p>
