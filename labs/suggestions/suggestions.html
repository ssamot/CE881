<h1 id="ce881-assignment-suggestions">CE881: Assignment Suggestions</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The suggested projects on this page are just a sample of what might be appropriate for your CE881 assignment, and give an idea of what could be expected, though you’ll be developing your apps with a much smaller budget of time and money, so your apps might not be quite as polished as some of the highly popular ones listed below.  Some more are more complex than others.  The complexity / ambition of the app will be taken into account when marking, so simpler apps are expected to be more polished than more complex ones.  Where links are given to existing apps, these are intended for background information and inspiration: you should not aim to simply replicate an existing app. </p>
<p>Your chosen app should satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help demonstrate that you’ve achieved the learning outcomes of the course.  Therefore, it should involve a significant amount of Android programming: simply putting content into an existing app engine would not be acceptable.</li>
<li>Be a useful and interesting app</li>
<li>Run robustly: it should not crash</li>
<li>The software should be well designed and be easy to modify or extend where appropriate</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on the examples below to read more about the apps.  Most of them can be installed for free on Android, though HarborMaster is an iOS app.</p>
<h2 id="interactive-audience-app">Interactive Audience App</h2>
<p>These are also known as personal response systems (PRS), and are used on TV’s “Who Wants To Be a Millionnaire?” for the “ask the audience” parts.  The main idea for this app is that a presenter can ask the audience a question, and get an immediate response back.  This is often a multiple-choice question, but may be more complex than that, and could involve typing an answer or drawing a quick sketch for example.  Note: some of this functionality can be provided simply via web pages that work on mobile devices, but some of the more sophisticated parts may be better served in a stand-alone app.  Background research for this project should include an investigation of the pros and cons of the app versus the web-page approach.  One advantage for the App might be immediate communication between presenter and audience without going via the web (not relying on the web may have advantages in terms of managing the delivery of questions, and also in working in locations where good wireless connections are unavailable).</p>
<h2 id="arcade-shooter">Arcade Shooter</h2>
<p>There is a significant demand for retro-style arcade shooters such as Asteroids.  The basic techniques for implementing one of these will be covered on the course.  The one shown below is a free app called AstroBlast.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=badger.ati.astroblast"><img src="img1F.jpg" alt="AstroBlast" /></a></p>
<h2 id="reaction-game">Reaction Game</h2>
<p>This example is a 2 (or 4) player reaction game where players compete to analyse whether a particular fact is true, or to solve a puzzle in the minimum time.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coolcherrytrees.games.reactor"><img src="img1C.jpg" alt="2 Player Reactor" /></a></p>
<h2 id="physics-based-game">Physics Based Game</h2>
<p>These are games where a physics simulator provides a major part of the game.  Examples include Angry Birds.  Note: writing a physics engine would be beyond the scope of this course, but students can use AndEngine: a physics and graphics engine for Android.  This provides the necessary support for developing 2D physics-based games.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.angrybirds"><img src="img1E.jpg" alt="Angry Birds Screenshots" /></a></p>
<h2 id="organisational-game">Organisational Game</h2>
<p>This involves scheduling or some other kind of low-level planning for various purposes such as maximising some reward or averting a disaster.  Classic example: Harbor Master on iOS, see also Harbor Captain on Android.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/harbor-master/id313014213?mt=8"><img src="img1A.jpg" alt="Harbor Master" /></a></p>
<h2 id="sports-tracker">Sports Tracker</h2>
<p>These apps track you while you perform a sports activity and store data for later retrieval and analysis.  They then offer features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plotting routes on a map</li>
<li>Estimating calories burned</li>
<li>Statistics on time spent, distance covered etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example include Endomondo (though I’ve notice that the mapping and distance covered can be extermely innaccurate when the GPS signal is poor, and does not seem to apply any constraints or common sense to distance estimates…)</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.endomondo.android"><img src="img1D.jpg" alt="Endonomdo Sports Tracker" /></a></p>
<h2 id="local-tourism-app">Local Tourism App</h2>
<p>This aims to provide visitors to a region with useful information on local sites and services.  This App is sponsored by Tendring District Council.  Some of this image may be fairly static such as information on parks and beaches, while others may be more dynamic such as opening times of shops and services, restaurant special offiers etc.  A sample app for San Francisco can be found here to give an idea of what you might offer:</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripadvisor.android.apps.cityguide.sanfrancisco&amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripadvisor.android.apps.cityguide.sanfrancisco&amp;hl=en<br />
 <img src="img19.jpg" alt="San Francisco App" /></a></p>
<h2 id="social-apps">Social Apps</h2>
<p>This is a very broad genre, and many games offer some kind of social interaction such as notification of high scores.  For this type of app though, the main emphasis is on the social interaction.</p>
<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>
<p>Examples in this category include apps for elder-care and assisted living.  These can monitor the activity of a user and provide reminders for taking exercise and medicine for example.</p>
<h2 id="research-apps">Research Apps</h2>
<p>These are apps whose main purpose is not some commercial application, but exposing some research question. If you are interested in a Research Project talk to me, but</p>
<ul>
<li>Voting</li>
<li>Generative Art</li>
<li>Recognition of food items/price comparison</li>
<li>Location aware applications -</li>
<li>GVGA-AI / AI testing on a mobile phone</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spot-it">SPOT IT</h3>
<p>Research in decision making usually uses experiments to investigate different methods where participants have to take a decision from a range of possible answers (e.g., two for binary decisions). “Spot it” is an app that could help researchers in developing experiments for smartphones in an easy way, so that they can acquire data from a large range of participants. It is a game-style app where participants have to spot a target in a picture that is showed for a very limited period of time. After seeing the picture, the participant has to answer YES or NO by pressing a button. The app should allow the researcher to configure the experiments (for example, through an “admin area” linked to a server), including: a) upload the pictures that will be presented to the participants (i.e., stimuli). This might be done to a server and then the app synchronise to it when it starts by downloading all the pictures. b) choose how many stimuli should be presented in an experiment, the target rate (i.e., the ratio number of stimuli with target / total number of stimuli), the duration of each stimulus (e.g., 250ms) c) decide whether the sequence of the stimuli should be the same for all users or randomised d) have a button to “enable” the experiment, so that users can start doing it on their smartphones Every time a user does the experiment, the app should assign him/her a unique ID and make sure the same person doesn’t do the experiment multiple times. It should also collect data such as the gender, the handedness and the age of the participant (e.g., by asking him/her). The results of the experiment (i.e., the answer of the user in each stimulus and the response time) should then be stored on a server and made available to the researcher to download (e.g., JSON protocol).</p>
